# Tic_Tac_Toe
This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using Pythonâ€™s tkinter library for the graphical user interface. Players take turns marking X or O on a 3x3 grid, aiming to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). The game detects wins, draws, and allows players to play interactively.
